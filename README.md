## How to run
1) Clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashish-choudhari-git/WeatherNest.git
```

2) Put your API key in this file (donâ€™t commit this file to the repo):
   - File: `assets/js/config.js`
   - Variable:

     ```javascript
     window.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY";
     ```

   Make sure `index.html` loads `config.js` before `assets/js/api.js`:

   ```html
   <script src="assets/js/config.js"></script>
   <script type="module" src="assets/js/api.js"></script>
   <script type="module" src="assets/js/app.js"></script>
   ```
